# Fluxo

Fluxo is a SwiftUI IPTV / M3U player for iOS and macOS.

## Building

Open `Fluxo.xcodeproj` in Xcode 26 or later and run the `Fluxo` scheme.
The app needs iOS 26 / macOS 26.

Live streams go through a small C remux engine
(`Fluxo/Features/Player/Engine`) built on FFmpeg's libavformat, libavcodec
and libavutil. The engine copies the stream into HLS segments on disk, and a
local HTTP server bound to `127.0.0.1` gives them to AVPlayer.

### iOS

The bundled FFmpeg 6 frameworks in `fmpeg-arm64/ffmpeg/framework` are linked
and embedded. You do not need to install anything. These frameworks contain
only an iOS device `arm64` slice, so build for a real device
(`generic/platform=iOS`). The iOS Simulator cannot link them.

### macOS

The Mac app links FFmpeg from Homebrew. Install it first:

```sh
brew install ffmpeg
```

The project expects FFmpeg at `/opt/homebrew/opt/ffmpeg` (Apple silicon
Homebrew). To use another prefix, change the `FFMPEG_MACOS_PREFIX` build
setting. The app loads the Homebrew dylibs at runtime, so the hardened runtime
uses the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement
(`Fluxo/Fluxo-macOS.entitlements`). The same file grants the sandbox
`network.client` (to read streams) and `network.server` (for the loopback HLS
server).

The macOS build is signed ad hoc ("Sign to Run Locally") so that it builds
without a Mac Development certificate. To distribute the app, set the macOS
code signing style back to Automatic. A distributed build must also embed
FFmpeg, because it cannot depend on Homebrew being installed.

Command-line builds:

```sh
# iOS device (unsigned)
xcodebuild -project Fluxo.xcodeproj -scheme Fluxo -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO

# macOS
xcodebuild -project Fluxo.xcodeproj -scheme Fluxo -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

## Playlist import

Playlists are streamed from the network (`DownloadManager`), parsed incrementally
by a byte-level M3U parser (`M3UParser`), and stored in batches on a background
`ModelContext` (`PlaylistImporter`). The main actor only receives throttled
progress (`PlaylistImportCenter`). A refresh writes a complete new copy of the
channels and switches to it only when the copy is fully stored. If the refresh is
cancelled or fails, the previous channels are kept.

To benchmark the old and new pipelines on a synthetic 100k-entry playlist, and to
run the parser edge-case self test:

```sh
Tools/PlaylistBenchmark/run.sh             # ENTRIES=20000 for a quicker run
```

## Home, favorites and search

- **Home** (`Features/Home`) shows a playlist switcher ("All Playlists" plus one
  chip per playlist), a featured carousel, Continue Watching, Favorites, and the
  groups of the chosen kind (Live TV / Movies / Series). Each group is a lazy row
  of its first 24 channels, with "See All" opening a paged grid. Group rows are
  fetched 8 at a time as they scroll in.
- **Content kinds** are guessed once at import time (`ChannelContentKind`) from
  the URL (Xtream `/movie/` and `/series/` paths, file extensions) and from the
  names (`S01E02`, "Series" groups). Each group gets the most common kind of its
  channels. Playlists imported before this change show as Live TV until refreshed.
- **Favorites and watch history** are `ChannelBookmark` rows keyed by
  playlist + stream URL, so they survive refreshes (which rewrite channel rows),
  and they are deleted with their playlist. The history keeps the 200 most recent
  entries.
- **Search** debounces typing by 250 ms and runs the name query on a background
  context, with a limit, over the selected playlist or all of them.
- **macOS** uses a sidebar (Home, Search, Favorites, Recently Watched,
  Recordings, and each playlist) and a Settings window (Cmd-,). iOS uses tabs.

To check every Home and Search query against an on-disk store (100k channels):

```sh
CHANNELS=100000 Tools/HomeQueriesCheck/run.sh
```

## Player

- **Routing** (`PlaybackRoute`): HLS playlists and MP4/MOV files play directly in
  AVPlayer. Raw MPEG-TS channels (no extension or `.ts`, or `udp://`, `rtmp://`,
  `rtsp://`, `srt://`) go through the remux engine, which writes local HLS that
  AVPlayer reads from the loopback server (`127.0.0.1:19123` only).
  Live channels with `.m3u8` URLs play directly in AVPlayer, so they use the
  DVR window of the source playlist (if it has one) and cannot be recorded.
  An on-demand `.ts` file served over HTTP ends normally once its last byte is
  read; any other end of a live input is treated as a dropped connection.
- **Deterministic start**: the engine has its own HLS segmenter and reports each
  completed segment. The player item is created once, after the first segment
  exists and the server is listening. There is no polling.
- **Time shift (DVR)**: live channels keep a sliding window of 30 minutes by
  default (5 to 120 minutes in Settings, `PlayerPreferences`), with a disk budget of
  512 MB per 30 minutes, or a tenth of the free disk space if that is smaller.
  Segments that leave the window are deleted. You can pause, resume, scrub, skip
  back or forward (10 s / 30 s by default, configurable), and go back to live
  (`AVPlayerViewModel`).
- **Reconnection**: when a live input drops or ends, the engine reconnects with
  backoff (0.5 s to 8 s, 10 attempts). Buffered media keeps playing in the
  meantime, and the playlist continues with `EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY`.
- **Recording**: the record button writes the live stream to
  `Documents/Recordings/<channel>-<date>.ts`, which is a second output of the
  engine. When the recording stops, it is converted to `.mp4` (stream copy) so
  that you can play it and seek in it. Recordings can be listed, played and
  deleted from the player, the Home toolbar or the macOS sidebar. The conversion writes a
  hidden temporary file that is renamed when complete. Recordings interrupted
  by a crash are converted at the next launch.
- **One player per app**: `FluxoApp` owns the only `AVPlayerViewModel`. The
  main UI is a single `Window` on macOS, and multiple scenes are disabled on
  iOS, because the loopback port, the PiP surface and the segment directory can
  have only one owner. Startup cleanup (leftover segments, interrupted
  recordings) runs once per process, before the first session starts, and only
  in the instance that holds `tmp/fluxo-instance.lock`, so a second copy of the
  app sharing the same container never deletes files the first one writes.
- **Picture in Picture**: the player draws its own controls, so the video is a bare
  `AVPlayerLayer` driven by an `AVPictureInPictureController` (`PlayerSurface`). Both
  belong to the view model, so PiP keeps running when the player screen closes, and the
  PiP button of the player (or Playback > Picture in Picture, ⌥⌘P) starts it. Stopping
  PiP presents the player again. On iOS PiP also starts automatically when you leave the
  app while a video plays (a Settings toggle), the audio session uses `.playback` /
  `.moviePlayback` and the `audio` background mode. `NowPlayingController` publishes the
  channel to the Lock Screen / Now Playing menu and handles its play, pause, skip and
  next / previous channel commands.

Engine smoke tests (macOS, Homebrew FFmpeg). They serve a generated live
stream on 127.0.0.1:

```sh
Tools/EngineSmokeTest/run.sh           # window cleanup, reconnection, recording + MP4 conversion
Tools/EngineSmokeTest/run_avplayer.sh  # AVPlayer pause/resume/skip/go-live on the engine output
```

Debug builds (`Fluxo/App/Debug/DebugAutoplay.swift`) also accept `-FluxoDebugAutoplayURL <url>`, which plays a stream at
launch, `-FluxoDebugRecordSeconds <n>`, which records it for n seconds, and `-FluxoDebugPictureInPicture YES`, which
starts Picture in Picture once it is possible and stops it 6 seconds later. The shared scheme builds Release, so build
these with `-configuration Debug`.

## User interface

- **Player screen** (`Features/Watch/WatchChannelView.swift`): the video fills the screen
  (iOS full-screen cover; on macOS it covers the main window, whose toolbar is hidden
  meanwhile). The top bar shows close, the channel logo and name, the status (connecting,
  buffering, reconnecting, `LIVE`, time-shifted `-m:ss`, paused, ended, error) and the
  recording indicator, plus PiP, AirPlay, full screen (macOS) and a menu (fill / fit,
  recordings, stop). The bottom bar has a scrubber (on-demand position, or the time-shift
  window of a live channel), channel down / up, skip back / forward, play / pause, Record
  and Go Live (see "Liquid Glass" below for how these controls morph). Controls fade out after 4 s of playback without interaction and come back on
  a tap or mouse move; they stay up while paused, buffering, failed, scrubbing or with
  VoiceOver on. Errors and the end of a stream show a card with Try Again / Play Again.
- **Channel zapping** (`ChannelZapper`): channel up / down plays the next / previous
  channel of the group of the playing channel, in playlist order, wrapping around. Each
  step is one indexed single-row fetch. It is offered for live channels started from a
  playlist (not recordings) and disabled while recording.
- **Cards**: live channels are 5:3 logo cards, movies and series 2:3 posters. Without
  usable artwork a card shows the channel's initials on a gradient whose color is derived
  from the name. Cards lift on hover and keyboard focus (macOS) and under the iPad pointer,
  and have a combined VoiceOver label (name, kind, playlist, favorite) and a favorite action.
- **Add / edit playlist**: a form with URL validation (http/https and a host), paste from
  the clipboard, a name suggested from the URL, determinate or indeterminate import progress
  with Cancel Import, and an error section with Try Again. Editing can change the URL, which
  re-imports the playlist.
- **Settings** (a tab on iOS, the Settings window ⌘, on macOS): time-shift length, skip
  intervals, automatic PiP (iOS), recordings count / size / location (Show in Finder on macOS,
  the Files app on iOS through `UIFileSharingEnabled`), delete all recordings, temporary stream
  files, logo cache, watch history, and the app and FFmpeg versions.
- **Recordings**: play, share, Show in Finder (macOS), delete, delete all.
- **Menu bar** (macOS, and the iPad menu bar): File > Add Playlist… (⌘N), Refresh All
  Playlists (⌘R); Playback > Play/Pause (Space), Skip Back / Forward (⌘← / ⌘→), Go Live (⌘L),
  Channel Up / Down (⌘↑ / ⌘↓), Record (⇧⌘R), Picture in Picture (⌥⌘P), Fill Video, Show
  Player (⇧⌘P), Stop Playback (⌘.). Shortcuts that would clash with text editing (Space, the
  arrows) are only enabled while the player is on screen. Escape closes the player.
- **Haptics** (iOS): channel changes, recording start / stop, favorites, and the result of a
  playlist import.

## Liquid Glass (iOS 26)

Glass is used for the navigation and control layer only (tab bar, toolbars, the mini player,
the playlist chips, the player controls, sheets). Cards, rows and banners are content and use
plain surfaces or small materials.

- **Tab bar**: a native `TabView` with Home, Favorites, Settings and a `.search` role tab. It
  minimizes while scrolling down (`tabBarMinimizeBehavior(.onScrollDown)`).
- **Mini player** (`PlayerBottomAccessory` in `App/ContentView.swift`): the
  `tabViewBottomAccessory`, shown only while something plays (on iOS 26.1+ through
  `isEnabled:`; iOS 26.0 cannot hide it and shows "Not Playing"). It reads
  `tabViewBottomAccessoryPlacement`: expanded, it shows the artwork, the title, a status line
  (LIVE and group, recording with a pulsing symbol, PiP, buffering), play / pause and close;
  inline (next to the minimized tab bar), only the artwork, the title and play / pause.
- **Zoom transitions** (`App/Design/ZoomTransitions.swift`): the full-screen player zooms out of
  the card, billboard artwork, search result or mini player that opened it
  (`matchedTransitionSource` + `navigationTransition(.zoom)`); `PlayChannelAction` passes the
  source to `AVPlayerViewModel.presentationSourceID`, and paths without a card (PiP restore,
  recordings, Show Player) zoom from the mini player. A group's "See All" grid zooms out of its
  Home row or its search chip, and the Recordings sheet out of its toolbar button.
- **Home**: the featured billboard runs under the status bar and the floating toolbar, its
  blurred artwork uses `backgroundExtensionEffect()` (it also extends under the iPad sidebar and
  the landscape safe areas), stretches on overscroll and fades into the background so both light
  and dark mode stay legible. The inline title fades in once the billboard has scrolled away;
  the scroll edge effect is `.soft`. Recordings and the playlist menu are separate toolbar glass
  groups (`ToolbarSpacer(.fixed)`). The playlist chips share a `GlassEffectContainer` and the
  tinted selection glass keeps its `glassEffectID`, so it morphs from chip to chip.
- **Player controls**: floating glass clusters in one `GlassEffectContainer`. Channel and skip
  buttons merge into a capsule on each side (`glassEffectUnion`), play / pause is a larger
  circle tinted with the accent color while paused, Record stretches into a red-tinted
  `REC m:ss` timer with a pulsing dot, and a red LIVE indicator morphs into `-m:ss Go Live`
  when the stream is time-shifted (`glassEffectID`). PiP, AirPlay and the menu share one capsule.
- **Sheets**: Add / Edit Playlist and Recordings use `.medium` / `.large` detents; their forms
  hide the grouped background so the sheet's glass shows at partial height, and they use the
  iOS 26 `.cancel` / `.close` / `.confirm` button roles.
- **Motion and accessibility**: symbol transitions (`contentTransition(.symbolEffect(.replace))`)
  for play / pause, PiP and favorites, `.pulse` for recording and `.variableColor` for LIVE,
  haptics for play / pause, Go Live, chip selection and favorites. With Reduce Motion the glass
  morphs, symbol loops and the welcome animation are turned off; with Reduce Transparency the
  player scrims and the billboard fades get stronger (the system glass adapts on its own).
- **Tint**: the `AccentColor` asset is a violet with a lighter dark-mode variant; live and
  recording states stay red.

## Brand and app icon

The icon shows three streams of colour that flow in from the left and gather into a play
glyph: live channels flowing into one player.

### Palette

| Name | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Fluxo Violet | `#6A4CFF` | Primary brand colour; the top of the icon background. Close to the `AccentColor` asset (`#644FF8`, dark `#8B7AFF`). |
| Fluxo Ink | `#140F3C` | Deepest background; the bottom of the icon background. |
| Night | `#281D69` → `#0A0720` | The dark-appearance icon background. |
| Signal Cyan | `#3CD6FF` | Leading stream band; highlights and "live / connected" accents. |
| Lilac | `#A08CFF` | Middle stream band; secondary tints, selection on dark surfaces. |
| Flux Pink | `#FF5C9E` | Trailing stream band; a warm accent that can replace a plain red where the meaning is not an error. |
| Glyph White | `#FFFFFF` (dark: `#F0EDFF`) | The play glyph. |

The background is a linear gradient from the top left (Violet) to the bottom right (Ink).

### Files

- `Fluxo/AppIcon.icon`: the Icon Composer document used as the app icon on iOS and macOS
  (`ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon`; there is no `AppIcon.appiconset`). It has two
  Liquid Glass groups: **Play** (the glyph, 20 % translucency, neutral shadow) in front of
  **Stream** (the three bands, layer-colour shadow), both with specular highlights. The dark
  appearance has the Night background and a lavender glyph; the tinted and clear appearances are
  derived by the system from the layers. Open it in Icon Composer
  (`Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Icon Composer.app`) to adjust the glass settings. Xcode
  compiles it into `Assets.car` (and `AppIcon.icns` / `AppIcon60x60@2x.png` fallbacks).
- `Design/Icon/Fluxo.vectorcraft`: the editable master in [VectorCraft](https://github.com/storytold/vectorcraft),
  one layer per icon layer plus a reference background. `Design/Icon/Layers/*.svg` are the layer
  exports (1024 × 1024), and `Fluxo-flat.svg` all layers together.
- `Design/Icon/generate_layers.py`: draws the master with the headless VectorCraft CLI (the
  geometry is computed in the script: the band centre lines, their stroke width, outline and
  fade-in, and the live corners of the glyph), exports the layer SVGs and copies them into
  `Fluxo/AppIcon.icon/Assets`. `vectorcraft-cli` is in the
  `vectorcraft-cli-<version>-macos-universal.zip` release asset (the app bundle does not include it):

  ```sh
  VECTORCRAFT_CLI=/path/to/vectorcraft-cli Design/Icon/generate_layers.py
  ```
- `Design/Icon/render_previews.sh [dir]`: renders the icon with Icon Composer's `ictool` in the
  Default, Dark, Clear (light / dark) and Tinted (light / dark) appearances for iOS and macOS.

## Memory

- **Logos and posters** (`Fluxo/App/Images`): every image goes through the shared
  `LogoImageLoader`, shown by the `LogoImage` view. Images are decoded off the main
  thread with ImageIO directly at the displayed size
  (`CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex`), never at the source resolution. Decoded
  bitmaps live in a cost-bounded `NSCache` (about 1.5% of RAM, 24 to 96 MB), which is
  emptied on iOS memory warnings and when the app goes to the background. Downloaded
  bytes are kept in an on-disk `URLCache` (`Caches/LogoImages`, 200 MB), which you can
  clear in Settings. Requests for the same image share one load, and a load is cancelled
  when the last view waiting for it disappears. Inline `data:image` logos are decoded
  once and then served from memory.
- **SwiftData**: the Watch list fetches groups 25 at a time and loads the next page when
  the last section appears. Each group strip fetches 50 channels, and "Show all" pages its
  grid 60 channels at a time. The player only keeps `PlayableChannel` values, never
  models. Imports use short-lived background contexts, one for each batch.
- **Player**: AVPlayer buffers at most 8 s ahead for local (remuxed) streams and 30 s for
  remote items. Stopping playback releases the player item and the engine session. The
  time-shift window is limited to 30 min / 512 MB, and never more than a tenth of the
  free disk space (with a 64 MB minimum). Remuxed on-demand items (local `.ts` files,
  such as recordings that could not be converted to MP4) are kept whole, so every
  position stays seekable; they are only played when the copy (about the size of the
  file) fits in the free space with a 256 MB margin.
- **Observation**: the player, the timeline, the recordings, the import center and
  Settings use `@Observable`. A view re-renders only for the properties it reads, so,
  for example, playback state changes no longer re-render the playlist browser.

Measurement tools (macOS):

```sh
Tools/ImageLoaderBenchmark/run.sh   # former logo path vs LogoImageLoader, on 127.0.0.1
Tools/EngineSmokeTest/leaks.sh      # engine sessions under `leaks --atExit`; FOOTPRINT_ONLY=1 prints the footprint per cycle
```
